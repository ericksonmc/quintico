# React Basic App

This is a basic react app for tests purposes

## Development
Start babel script to transpile jsx code
```bash
npm start
```
Open any web server to access the app, for example you can use PHP:
```bash
php -S localhost:3000
```

## Production
Build production code running:
```bash
npm run build
```

Change the react scripts in the index.html to use the production version replacing `.development` for `.production`
